# MyPortfolio
A professional portfolio created using React.

## Description

My portfolio still needs some work! It is very basic and I couldn't get my projects to display. I will continue to work on this and update it as I learn more about React. I also had an issue with deploying to Netlify, however when I viewed the portfolio locally, I could see the changes I made. I will also continue to look for this bug.
